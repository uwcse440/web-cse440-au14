# CSE 440 - Introduction to HCI

## Autumn 2014

# Course Description

This course provides an introduction to human-computer interaction and the design process. 
It is overwhelmingly organized around a group project, in which students:

- Ideate and Propose Design Problems
- Study Existing Practices and Challenges
- Explore Potential Design Opportunities and Tradeoffs
- Evaluate and Improve a Design
- Communicate their Problem and Resulting Design

## Project Theme

Projects are exploring challenges and opportunities in Personal Informatics:

> Personal informatics systems are systems that help people collect personally relevant information for the purpose of 
> self-reflection and gaining self-knowledge.
>
> [Li _et al._, 2010](http://www.personalinformatics.org/lab/model/).

People have long sought to better understand themselves, but recently technology advances are enabling fundamentally new approaches. 
Students will explore the problems people encounter and how new technology can help people reaching their goals. 

## Project Structure

Projects are organized around four assignments, each consistent of several milestones:

- [Assignment 1 - Project Proposal]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/assignment1/)
- [Assignment 2 - Getting the Right Design]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/assignment2/)
- [Assignment 3 - Getting the Design Right]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/assignment3/)
- [Assignment 4 - Communicating the Design]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/assignment4/)

Example project from prior offerings include: 

- [Plantr](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/13au/projects/plantr/)
- [NutriView](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/13au/projects/nutriview/)
- [JuiceBox](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/13au/projects/juicebox/)

Note the project structure has changed since these prior offerings, so their reports do not map to the current project.
However, these represent examples of strong work in this course.

# Grading

The overall course grade will be computed as follows:

- Group Project (__65%__)
  - Assignment 1, Project Proposal (__3%__)
  - Assignment 2, Getting the Right Design (__21%__)
    - Milestones (__6%__)
    - Final Report (__15%__)
  - Assignment 3, Getting the Design Right (__14%__)
    - Milestones (__4%__)
    - Final Report (__10%__)
  - Assignment 4, Communicating the Design (__15%__)
    - Milestones (__2%__)
    - Project Website (__4%__)
    - Video Prototype (__5%__)
    - Poster (__4%__)
  - Presentations (__12%__)
    - Getting the Right Design Presentation (__5%__)
    - Getting the Design Right Presentation (__5%__)
    - Individual Presentation Score (__2%__)
- Exam (__25%__)
- Individual Readings (__5%__)
- Participation (__5%__)

Each assignment will also provide a point breakdown intended to convey how it will be graded. 
Design is an inherently subjective practice, and so grading in this course is necessarily subjective.
Wow us with your work.

Because the course is designed around feedback on project milestones, grades given to those milestones indicate
that you have invested sufficient effort and insight at the time of the milestone.
You will get feedback and are expected to continue acting upon that feedback in your design process.
The bulk of project grades is therefore attached to the final deliverables, which are evaluated on their quality.

# Submission

Many assignments are due "the night before class". Catalyst implements this as 4:00am.

In order to be prepared to give you feedback, the course staff must have your submission in the morning.
Submitting the day of class, just before class, or in class is therefore unacceptable, risking zero credit.

Submissions should be in PDF format (i.e., not plain text, not Word). 
The PDF should be 'printable', containing everything we need to review and grade the assignment (e.g., your name).
The course staff has a large number of submissions to manage, so format and completeness issues are problematic.
