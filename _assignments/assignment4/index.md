# Project Description

In this assignment, you communicate your design in several forms.
You will create a video prototype, a website, a poster, and a pitch to present your work from the entire quarter.

1. Create a video prototype that illustrates your proposed design. 
   Use the storyboards you created as a basis for your video prototype. 
   Be sure you video conveys all of:
   
   - the problem
   - the design
   - the context 
   - the satisfaction
   
   Refer to the examples provided in lecture, as well as videos from prior classes, for creating an effective video.

   It is critical that your video be short enough to remain engaging while delivering its content.
   Your video prototype should probably not be more than 2 minutes long.

   A modern phone can capture video of adequate quality for this assignment. 
   However, if your group does not have access to a camera, we can loan you a low cost camera.
   Please contact us immediately if this is a need.

2. Create a project website that provides an overview of the project, 
   presents your video prototype, presents your design process,
   and introduces team members. At a minimum, it should include links to your 
   [Assignment 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/assignment2/) report, 
   your [Assignment 3]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/assignment3/) report, and your poster.
   Optionally, also include your presentations or other materials.
   
   Be sure you have updated any documents that course staff said needed fixed before posting 
   (e.g., any report that accidentally included participant identifying information). 

3. Create a poster that communicates your design and your design process to a general audience.
   The goal is to present your work in a visual form to interested parties from across campus or from industry. 
   You need to quickly convey the most important aspects of your work. 
   The poster must be 32"x40" (portrait, vertical). 
   
4. Create a pitch that you can deliver together with your poster.
   This should summarize the problem and your design.
   It should be no more than 1 minute long.
   This pitch should convince the audience your problem was worth investigating and that your design effectively addresses it.

# Deliverables

<a name="initial_video_prototype"></a>

## 4a: Initial Video Prototype

Due: Uploaded the night before class Tuesday, November 25, 2014

Submit your video prototype in a portable and playable format.
It should be playable on a Windows 7/8 laptop and Mac OS X laptop without special codecs installed (e.g., H.264 in an mp4 container). 
It should be sufficiently high-resolution for projection, but sufficiently compressed that it can be played on a typical laptop. 
It should be less than 50 MB in size. 

Remember it should probably not be more than 2 minutes long.

We recommend encoding your video using open-source tool HandBrake together with its iPad preset.

If you contact us regarding early drafts of your video, we will test that they play properly.

### Submission

Submit via Catalyst here: 

{% if page.link_project4a != nil %}<{{ page.link_project4a }}>{% else %}`Catalyst link to be added`{% endif %}

### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __6 points__:

1.  __Conveys Problem, Design, Context, and Satisfaction__: (3 points)
2.  __Appropriately Polished and Timed__: (3 points)

Your video prototype should be complete and will be evaluated as such.
But later critique and refinement will help further improve it before the final poster session.

<a name="initial_website"></a>

## 4b: Initial Website

Due: Uploaded before end of day Wednesday, November 26, 2014

We will use your websites and video to advertise the poster session.
Although this is in an initial website on which you will get feedback and will be able to update,
you should submit complete and high-quality versions of your website and video.

Your website will be served from a subdirectory of this course website:

- [Aqueous]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/aqueous/)
- [Awearness]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/awearness/)
- [Band-It]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/bandit/)
- [DisTrack]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/distrack/)
- [GroupShop]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/groupshop/)
- [IE+]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/ieplus/)
- [Katching]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/katching/)
- [Koala]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/koala/)
- [Running With Friends]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/runningwithfriends/)
- [SoundScape]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/soundscape/)

You can build your website however you like, but everything needed for your site must be in your directory.
Do not attempt to integrate with the Jekyll functionality used for this course website.
Simply build your website and submit the set of static files to be served from your directory. 

### Submission

First, follow the [contributing instructions]({{ site.baseurl }}/contributing.html) 
to submit a pull request containing the content for your project website. 
Your request should not modify anything outside your project website.

Submit simple pull requests early so that you become familiar with this functionality.
Do not wait until the final moments to begin to learn how to do this.

If you are absolutely unable to submit a pull request, submit via Catalyst here:

{% if page.link_project4b != nil %}<{{ page.link_project4b }}>{% else %}`Catalyst link to be added`{% endif %}

### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __8 points__:

1.  __Completeness of Content__: (3 points)
2.  __Appropriately Polished Presentation__: (3 points)
3.  __Submitted via Pull Request__: (2 points)

Your website should be complete and will be evaluated as such.
But later critique and refinement will help further improve it before the final poster session.

## 4c Poster Critique and Pitch

Due: Uploaded the night before class Thursday, December 4, 2014

Your poster should include:

- Logo
- Project Title
- Problem
- Value Proposition
- Key Functionality
- Design Process and Iteration

Your poster should include images and limited amounts of text.

There is a 32"x40" PowerPoint Template available [here](posters/sample-poster.ppt).

There are additional examples of prior posters [here](posters/).

During the final poster session, your team will give a one minute pitch to a small group of judges. 

Be prepared to give this pitch in class December 4.
Course staff and other students will give feedback so you can improve before the final poster session.

### Submission

Submit your poster via Catalyst here: 

{% if page.link_project4c != nil %}<{{ page.link_project4c }}>{% else %}`Catalyst link to be added`{% endif %}

Your poster may be in PPT, PPTX, or PDF format. 
We have a color plotter that can print posters this size. 
Your source file is due as above, we will then coordinate with you for proofreading and printing.

Be prepared to give your elevator pitch in class.

## 4d: Poster Session, Final Video, and Final Website

Due: Website/video/poster uploaded the night before the final exam block. Attend during the final exam block on Monday, December 8, 2014.

You’re almost done! Attend to the final exam block so you can show off your poster and look
at your classmate's posters. We will __not be conducting any evaluation__ at the poster
session itself. Instead, take the opportunity to look at other student's work, chat with judges,
and reflect on a busy and productive quarter.

### Submission

Submit a pull request for your final website and video before the poster
session.

Submit your poster via Catalyst here: {% if page.link_project4d != nil %}<{{ page.link_project4d }}>{% else %}`Catalyst link to be added`{% endif %}

* The website includes links to your previous reports and your video prototype.

##### Visual Design (5 points)

* The website follows design principles that we have discussed in this course.
* The website looks professional and is something you would consider including in a design portfolio.

<!--
As I said in email, I don't think this fits in with your new model of the poster session.

#### Pitch (50 points)

* Is it appropriately timed and prepared? (less than __one minute__)
* Does it convey the problem and your solution?
* Does it convey the work you’ve done to refine and validate your solution?

TODO: make this the last required reading, perhaps?

#### Video peer reviews (1 points)

`decide if we're doing video peer reviews`

It is important for video prototypes to be accessible and appeal to a large
audience. To measure how well your prototype succeeds at this, we will have each
of you rate the videos as you watch them (including your own teams’ video).
