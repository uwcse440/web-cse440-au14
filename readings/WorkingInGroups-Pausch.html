<p><font size="3"><b>Meet people properly</b>. It all starts with the introduction. Then, exchange contact
information, and make sure you know how to pronounce everyone's names. Exchange phone
numbers, and find out what hours are acceptable to call during.</font></p>
<font size="3"><b>

</b></font><p><font size="3"><b>Find things you have in common</b>. You can almost always find something in common with
another person, and starting from that baseline, it's much easier to then address
issues where you have differences. This is why cities like professional sports teams,
which are socially galvanizing forces that cut across boundaries of race and wealth. If
nothing else, you probably have in common things like the weather.</font></p>
<font size="3"><b>

</b></font><p><font size="3"><b>Make meeting conditions good</b>. Have a large surface to write on, make sure the room
is quiet and warm enough, and that there aren't lots of distractions. Make sure no
one is hungry, cold, or tired. Meet over a meal if you can; food <i><b>softens</b></i> a
meeting. That's why they "do lunch" in Hollywood.</font></p>
<font size="3"><b>

</b></font><p><font size="3"><b>Let everyone talk</b>. Even if you think what they're saying is stupid. Cutting
someone off is rude, and not worth whatever small time gain you might make. Don't
finish someone's sentences for him or her; they can do it for themselves. And
remember: talking louder or faster doesn't make your idea any better.</font></p>
<font size="3"><b>

</b></font>
<p><font size="3"><b>Check your egos at the door</b>. When you discuss ideas, immediately label them and
write them down. The labels should be descriptive of the idea, not the originator:
"the troll bridge story," not "Jane's story."</font></p>
<font size="3"><b>

</b></font>
<p><font size="3"><b>Praise each other</b>. Find something nice to say, even if it's a stretch. Even
the worst of ideas has a silver lining inside it, if you just look hard enough. Focus on
the good, praise it, and then raise any objections or concerns you have about the rest of
it. </font></p>
<font size="3"><b>

</b></font>
<p><font size="3"><b>Put it in writing.</b> Always write down who is responsible for what, by when. Be <i><b>concrete</b></i>.
Arrange meetings by email, and establish accountability. Never assume that someone's
roommate will deliver a phone message. Also, remember that "politics is when you have
more than 2 people" and with that in mind, always CC (carbon copy) any piece of
email within the group, or to me, to <u><b>all members</b></u> of the group. This rule
should <i><b>never</b></i> be violated; don't try to guess what your group mates
might or might not want to hear about.</font></p>
<font size="3"><b>

</b></font>
<p><font size="3"><b>Be open and honest</b>. Talk with your group members if there's a problem, and
talk with me if you think you need help. The whole point of this course is that it's
tough to work across cultures. If we all go into it knowing that's an issue, we
should be comfortable discussing problems when they arise -- after all, that's what
this course is really about. Be forgiving when people make mistakes, but don't be
afraid to raise the issues when they come up,</font></p>
<font size="3"><b>

</b></font><p><font size="3"><b>Avoid conflict at all costs</b>. When stress occurs and tempers flare, take a short
break. Clear your heads, apologize, and take another stab at it. Apologize for upsetting
your peers, even if you think someone else was primarily at fault; the goal is to work
together, not start a legal battle over whose transgressions were worse. It takes two to
have an argument, so be the peacemaker.</font></p>
<font size="3"><b>

</b></font><p><font size="3"><b>Phrase alternatives as questions</b>. Instead of "I think we should do A, not
B," try "What if we did A, instead of B?" That allows people to offer
comments, rather than defend one choice.</font></p>
