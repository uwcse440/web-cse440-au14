# Overview

You are to propose a __problem__ and an __approach__ that could form the basis of a project for this course.
Successful projects will observe the need for good human-centered design in an interactive computing system, 
analyze the needs and opportunities in the problem, explore potential designs, and propose a compelling solution.

This assignment is worth __3%__ of your overall course grade:

- __0.5%__ for the proposal brainstorm
- __2.5%__ for the project proposal

# Milestones

This is an individual assignment, consisting of three milestones.

# Project Description

The theme for projects in this course is __personal informatics__:

> Personal informatics systems are systems that help people collect personally relevant information for the purpose of 
> self-reflection and gaining self-knowledge.
>
> [Li _et al._, 2010](http://www.personalinformatics.org/lab/model/).

Personal informatics relates heavily to the [Quantified Self](http://quantifiedself.com/) movement, which emphasizes:

> Self-knowledge through numbers.
>
> [Gary Wolf, 2009](http://archive.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/17-07/lbnp_knowthyself)
 
Current widely used examples of personal informatics systems include:

- [FitBit](http://www.fitbit.com/) (for tracking physical activity)
- [Glooko](http://glooko.com/) (for tracking diabetes outcomes)
- [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm) (for tracking music listening)
- [Mint](http://www.mint.com/) (for tracking finances)
- [Moves](http://www.moves-app.com/) (for tracking location)
- [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/) (for tracking food intake)
- [RunKeeper](http://www.runkeeper.com/) (for tracking physical activity)
- [Track your Happiness](https://www.trackyourhappiness.org/) (for tracking happiness)

Individuals have gone much deeper into their own data:

- [Feltron Report](http://feltron.com/) (a designer who tracks everything he does and releases an annual report)

Researchers have also studied current processes, challenges, and opportunities:

- [Li et al., 2010](http://www.personalinformatics.org/docs/lab/2010-chi-ianli-stage-based-model.pdf)
- [Choe et al., 2014](http://students.washington.edu/eunky/download/CHI-2014-Choe-QuantifiedSelf.pdf)
- [Rooksby et al., 2014](http://www.johnrooksby.org/papers/livedinformatics.pdf)

## Thinking Big
 
Your proposal must go beyond a technology-centric proposal of a webpage, phone application, or interaction. Think about 
the problems that people face in their lives, how we can approach those problems, and the role for interactive computing.
This first assignment is your opportunity to think broadly about identifying a problem. Subsequent assignments will provide 
opportunities to focus on designing a specific technological solution to a specific set of tasks.

You should identify and consider goals and activities that are important to people. Potential domains include:

 - living a healthy life
 - managing finances effectively
 - managing time effectively

Activities within personal informatics can include:

 - planning to begin to track
 - helping remember to track
 - identifying activity patterns 
 - sharing accomplishments with friends and family

Do not start with a focus on concrete one-time tasks (e.g., logging into your bank account). 
Instead identify problems in long-lived activities that span many different social or technological contexts. 
If you want to help people manage their money, do not immediately propose a website that addresses one specific task. 
Consider the range of other opportunities (e.g., personal mobile devices, shared family computers, point of sale systems).

Focus on creating or improving a specific application or service that addresses the issues of an actual community. 
You must be able to create and evaluate a design within the timeframe of this course, so consider whether you 
can reasonably gain access to the necessary people. We encourage you to think big, expanding upon your application 
to include new ideas for interaction techniques or technology platforms. 

Do not feel constrained by current devices, but instead aim to explore an exciting design that could potentially 
motivate the development of new enabling technology. For example, see how Artefact presents the Dialog concept:

- [Dialog: Better Decisions, Better Health - Artefact](http://www.artefactgroup.com/content/work/dialog/)
- [Video of Dialog Talk in DUB Seminar](http://vimeo.com/103167385)

## Going Forward

The course staff will select a subset of submitted proposals for sponsorship. Sponsored proposals will be posted,
and students will then bid on the projects they want to pursue in this course. Your proposal is thus an effort to 
convince both the staff and your classmates that a problem is interesting, tractable, and worthy of investigation.

# Deliverables

<a name="project_brainstorm"></a>

## 1a: Project Brainstorm

Due: Uploaded the night before section Friday, September 26, 2014

Propose three ideas as starting points for brainstorming.
Ensure the ideas are significantly different, not small variations on the same idea.
Each idea should be a single sentence. 

### Submission

No more than one page of text in PDF format. Submit via Catalyst here: 

{% if page.link_project1a != nil %}<{{ page.link_project1a }}>{% else %}`Catalyst link to be added`{% endif %}

If you are still attempting to add, or otherwise unable to access Catalyst, submit via the instructor email address.

In section, be prepared to discuss your initial ideas as part of a larger brainstorm.

### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __3 points__: One point for each unique proposed idea (i.e. don't submit small variations on the same idea).

<a name="project_proposal"></a>

## 1b: Project Proposal

Due: Uploaded the night before class Tuesday, September 30, 2014

In one paragraph, describe the problem and motivation. 
This description should convince the reader that this is a difficult and interesting problem, worth spending a quarter considering. 
State what the problem is and why it is a problem, or describe a new idea and why it will enhance an existing application or work practice.

In another paragraph, analyze the problem or idea to give more background and context. 
Do not just focus on the negative aspects of the current situation, but also identify some positive aspects that may be beneficial to retain. 
A few salient examples from existing systems or work practices should be used to support those claims.
If appropriate, you may conduct this analysis by describing a scenario that illustrates how someone might encounter and resolve the problem.

Ensure your report is appropriately clear and easy to read. This includes:

 - text should be clear and concise
 - use section headings as appropriate
 - include images in the body of the write-up with appropriate figure numbers and captions
 - refer to the figures in the body of your text
 - check for typos, spelling, and grammar errors

Be sure your presentation looks good:

 - choose appropriate colors, fonts, and styles
 - make liberal use of whitespace 

## Submission

No more than one page of text in PDF format.

Images do not count against your page limit, and are therefore effectively free. 
You should embed images throughout your PDF, keeping them near the text that references them.
The limit applies to the approximate amount of text you would have if all images were removed.

Submit via Catalyst here:

{% if page.link_project1b != nil %}<{{ page.link_project1b }}>{% else %}`Catalyst link to be added`{% endif %}

### Grading

This proposal will be graded on a scale of __10 points__:

1. __Problem and Motivation__: (3 points)
2. __Analysis of Problem__: (3 points)
3. __Novelty and Creativity__: (2 points)
4. __Report Clarity and Presentation__: (2 points)

You will submit a bid on projects and potential partners. Course staff will use your bids to assign projects and groups. 

### Submission

Submit your bid on projects and potential partners here:

{% if page.link_project1c_bids != nil %}<{{ page.link_project1c_bids }}>{% else %}`Catalyst link to be added`{% endif %}
