title: "Assignment 2: Getting the Right Design"
---

# Overview

Even for a well-understood, well-motivated problem, choosing a design to invest time into is a difficult and laborious process. 
This group assignment, spanning multiple weeks of the course, tackles the problem of selecting the right design through 
__contextual inquiry__, __task development__, __generating multiple potential designs__, and finally __selecting a design__ to pursue.

This assignment is worth __21%__ of your overall course grade. __15%__ of your course grade is derived from the final report (assignment 2h), with the remaining __6%__ from the other milestones (__0.5%__ from each of assignments 2a and 2b, __1%__ from assignments 2c, 2d, 2e, 2f, and 2g).

# Project Description

In this assignment, you will brainstorm a large set of possible tasks and design ideas for your project. 
You will then use contextual inquiry to learn more about your problem and the current practices of people who might use your design. 
You will draw upon the ideas developed in your brainstorming and the observations made in your contextual inquiry
to help develop a set of potential tasks your design might support. 
You will next sketch how a set of initial designs might support those tasks.
Finally, you will choose a design to pursue in the remainder of the course, storyboard the details of your design in
the context of important tasks, and present your design in a report and presentation.

More specifically, you will do the following:

1. Generate ideas for potential problems, tasks, features, and interactions using a group ideation exercise.

   ([Assignment 2a](#project_ideation))
    
2. Use the contextual inquiry method in observing and interviewing at least __three__ people who might use your design.

   ([Assignment 2b](#contextual_inquiry_plan)), ([Assignment 2c](#contextual_inquiry_checkin)), ([Assignment 2d](#contextual_inquiry_review))

3. Develop __six__ tasks that might be performed with your design. 

   Select these to capture the important aspects of the problem you are solving and to provide coverage of the designs 
   you will explore. Create these based on your observations and analyses of existing tasks as well as your vision for 
   new tasks enabled by potential designs. Remember that tasks say what is accomplished, while leaving open how to accomplish it. 
   
   As you progress through your project, you can and should consider revising your tasks. 
   Expect to refine or change your tasks as your understanding of the problem matures or according to feedback you receive.
   The tasks you report in this assignment therefore must be appropriate but are not necessarily final.

   ([Assignment 2e](#task_review)) 

4. Brainstorm and sketch __three__ very different initial designs for your interface. 
   Each design should support __four__ of your tasks.
   
   Do not illustrate the entire design, but instead sketch key aspects needed to illustrate the functionality. 
   These should be rough sketches on paper (i.e., not digital mockups), including illustrations of their relations 
   (e.g., arrows showing transitions and relationships).    
   
   The purpose of these sketches is to explore the design space before you lock yourself into a single design.
   They must demonstrate significant consideration of substantially different approaches to your problem.

   ([Assignment 2f](#design_checkin)), ([Assignment 2g](#design_review)) 

5. From your sketches, select __one__ design to pursue for the remainder of the quarter and __two__ tasks that emphasize
   critical functionality of your design. These tasks should be non-trivial, critical to solving your problem, and should 
   emphasize long-lived or repeated activities. In contrast, a one-time login screen for a social networking application 
   is not worth being the focus of your project, does not define your project functionality, and is not interesting.

   Storyboard your chosen design for your chosen tasks, illustrating how the tasks are accomplished in your design.

6. Summarize your design process in a report and presentation.

   ([Assignment 2h](#final_report))

# Deliverables

<a name="project_ideation"></a>

## 2a: Project Ideation

Due: Completed in section on Friday, October 3, 2014

Generate 64 different ideas related to your project proposal, including:

- problems: a need that a person might have 
- tasks: what a person might accomplish 
- features: a capability a design might have 
- interactions: how a feature might work 

We will provide large sheets of paper. Divide a large sheet of paper into 64 squares, each approximately 2in by 2in.
Sketch 64 ideas, one in each square. Each idea should be a quick doodle with a caption or a one-sentence idea. 
A person familiar with your project but not in your group should be able to understand the idea each sketch conveys.

The goal is to begin exploring the space of possibilities, not attempting to polish some particular possibility. 
Focus on the quantity of ideas, not the quality of any one idea. 
You may include ideas from existing products. No two ideas should be alike.
When you get stuck, find a context to inspire new ideas.

### Submission

In section, one of the course staff will sign off on what you completed.

You will be able to take your paper with you, and you should continue brainstorming throughout your project.

### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __3 points__ based on a good-faith attempt to generate ideas during the ideation brainstorming exercise.

<a name="contextual_inquiry_plan"></a>

## 2b: Contextual Inquiry Plan

Due: Uploaded the night before class Tuesday, October 7, 2014

In one paragraph, describe the people who might use your design and other stakeholders for your design. 
Describe the particular contextual inquiry participants you plan to pursue, 
including some details of their background and the environment where you will observe their current practices. 
Give enough details to convince us that you can actually find and interview your target participants in the next week. 

For example, your target participants should not be "doctors" but instead a specific group of doctors 
(e.g., Family Practitioners in the UW Roosevelt Clinic). 
If gaining access to the target participants is non-trivial (e.g., as with busy doctors), 
describe the steps you have taken to gain access and your plans to recover if you are unable to gain access. 
Indicate when you will be conducting your three inquiries, being as specific as possible.

In another paragraph, describe how you will interact with your participants and your role as the "apprentice".
 
- Will you be observing their current behaviors?
- Will you be interviewing them about recent behaviors?
 
Please be as specific as possible, providing potential examples of your observation focus or interview questions.

###Submission

No more than one page of text in PDF format. Submit via Catalyst here: `link to Catalyst` 

In lecture, be prepared to discuss the plan with other teams and the course staff.

### Grading

`This milestone will be graded on a scale of __3 points__ based on specificity and feasibility of the plan.`

<a name="contextual_inquiry_checkin"></a>

## 2c: Contextual Inquiry Check-In

Due: Uploaded the night before section Friday, October 10, 2014

Complete at least one contextual inquiry prior to this check-in. 
You hopefully learned something about the needs of people who might use your design, but also about how to conduct a contextual inquiry.

Describe your first inquiry: 

- Who you observed or interviewed, their background, and the environment.
- What did you learn? 
- What tasks, problems, or opportunities did you uncover? 
- Did you encounter any difficulties establishing rapport or getting the information you need?

Discuss what remains to be pursued after your first inquiry. We fully expect changes will be necessary, as inquiries 
can be difficult to get right and often important topics are left unresolved. 

- What are your plans for the remaining inquiries? 
- How do you plan to change your protocol based on what you learned in your first inquiry?

###Submission

No more than one page of text in PDF format. Submit via Catalyst here: `link to Catalyst`

In section, be prepared to discuss your contextual inquiry with other teams and the course staff.

### Grading

`This milestone will be graded on a scale of __6 points__:`

1.  `__The information gained from your first interview(s)__: (3 points)` 
2.  `__Your plan for your upcoming interviews__: (3 points)`  

<a name="contextual_inquiry_review"></a>

## 2d: Contextual Inquiry Review

Due: Uploaded the night before class Tuesday, October 14, 2014

#### Themes

Complete all three of your contextual inquiries. Discuss your process and what you learned:

- Who you observed or interviewed, their background, and the environment.
- Note anything unique about each inquiry and comment on the rationale behind these events.

Across the three inquiries, we expect some emergence of common themes, problems, and practices. 

- Identify high level themes the participants share in their practices. 
- Do these themes, problems, and practices suggest tasks to important to design for?

#### Task Analysis Questions

Provide brief answers to the following questions. These should help you begin to identify tasks essential to your design.

1. Who is going to use the design? 
2. What tasks do they now perform?
3. What tasks are desired?
4. How are the tasks learned?
5. Where are the tasks performed?
6. What is the relationship between the person and data?
7. What other tools does the person have?
8. How do people communicate with each other?
9. How often are the tasks performed?
10. What are the time constraints on the tasks?
11. What happens when things go wrong?

### Submission

No more than four pages of text in PDF format:

 - contexutal inquiry participants (less than one page)
 - contextual inquiry themes (less than one page)
 - task analysis questions (less than two pages)
 
Submit via Catalyst here: `link to Catalyst`

In lecture, be prepared to discuss your contextual inquiry with other teams and the course staff.

### Grading

`This milestone will be graded on a scale of __6 points__:`

1.  `__The description of the user group and quality of the themes developed__: (3 points)` 
2.  `__Answers to the task analysis questions__: (3 points)`  

<a name="task_review"></a>

## 2e: Task Review

Due: Uploaded the night before class Friday, October 17, 2014

Building on what you learned in your contextual inquiry, design six tasks that you believe are integral to your overall design goal:

 - You should include existing tasks (i.e., tasks people already do) and new tasks (i.e., tasks that will be enabled by your design). 
 - These should be real world tasks that have details (e.g., instead of "programming a DVR", details like "programming a DVR to record the Simpsons on Sundays"). 
 - These tasks should not have any specific relation to the exact design sketches you will brainstorm next. 
 - Your six tasks should span a wide range of functionality and difficulty, from easy to hard tasks.

Each task should be described in text. Tasks say what is accomplished, leaving open how to accomplish it.
So be sure that your task conveys a problem and what is accomplished, rather than a step-by-step walkthrough of a particular design.

### Submission

No more than two pages of text in PDF format: 

 - six task descriptions (one paragraph each)

Submit via Catalyst here: `link to Catalyst`

In section, be prepared to discuss your tasks with other teams and the course staff.

### Grading

`This milestone will be graded on a scale of __6 points__ (1 point for each task described).`

<a name="design_checkin"></a>

## 2f: Design Check-In ("3x4")

Due: Uploaded the night before class Tuesday, October 21, 2014

You have identified and described six important tasks for your design problem. 
You will now brainstorm and sketch three very different initial designs for your interface:
 
 - Each design should support four of your tasks, but they do not necessarily need to all support the same four tasks.
 - Do not illustrate the entire design, but instead sketch key aspects needed to illustrate the functionality. 
 - These should be rough sketches on paper (i.e., not digital mockups), including illustrations of their relations (e.g., arrows showing transitions and relationships).

The purpose of these sketches is to explore the design space before you lock yourself into a single design.
They must demonstrate significant consideration of substantially different approaches to your problem.

### Submission

No more than three pages of text in PDF format:

 - six task descriptions (one paragraph each, updated from prior assignment)
 - for each of three initial designs
   - the high-level idea of the design (one paragraph)
   - scanned images of the design (sketches, not digital mockups)
   - how to complete each the four sketched tasks (e.g., a list of steps, one or two sentences per task)

Images do not count against your page limit, and are therefore effectively free. 
You should embed images throughout your PDF, keeping them near the text that references them.
The limit applies to the approximate amount of text you would have if all images were removed.

Submit via Catalyst here: `link to Catalyst`

In lecture, be prepared to discuss your design sketches with other teams and the course staff.

### Grading

`This milestone will be graded on a scale of __6 points__ (2 points for each design).`

`We grade the designs on the quality and diversity of these ideas, as well as the execution (sketches are rough, transitions are clear, there is enough to get each idea across).`

<a name="design_review"></a>

## 2g: Design Review ("1x2")

Due: Uploaded the night before section Friday, October 24, 2014

From your design sketches, select one design that you will refine in the remainder of this course. 
Then select two tasks that will be the focus of your design refinement. 
The selected tasks need to be representative of the experience of using your design. 

Prepare one paragraph describing why you selected the design you did. 
Draw upon feedback from critiques and data from your contextual inquiry. 

 - Why this design and these tasks? 
 - What makes the design better suited to the people for whom you are targeting your design? 
 - Why are these tasks more compelling than the others? 

Convey a strong understanding of which design you chose, which tasks you chose, and why you chose them.

Then Create a storyboard of each task for your selected design. 
These should be done on paper, then scanned (i.e., do not create or recreate them in a drawing package). 
They should clearly indicate the functionality of the design and what the interface will be like,
conveying the major aspects of the design in enough detail that a person not in your group can understand 
how the design supports each task. 
As needed, add descriptions that explicitly reference the storyboard, add more sketches, or annotate them in multiple colors.

### Submission

No more than one page of text in PDF format:

 - discussion of your design and task choices (one paragraph)
 - scanned images of your storyboards and associated descriptions 

Images do not count against your page limit, and are therefore effectively free. 
You should embed images throughout your PDF, keeping them near the text that references them.
The limit applies to the approximate amount of text you would have if all images were removed.

Submit via Catalyst here: `link to Catalyst`

In section, be prepared to discuss your choices and storyboards with other teams and the course staff.

### Grading

`This milestone will be graded on a scale of __6 points__:`

1.  `__The rationale behind choosing the particular design__: (2 points)`
2.  `__The storyboard for each task__: (2 points x 2 tasks = 4 points)`

<a name="final_report">

## 2h: Final Report

Due: Uploaded the night before class Tuesday, October 28, 2014

Prepare a report documenting your design process.
Your report should follow the outline below, and will be graded using the guidelines that follow.
The provided page allocations are estimates, intended to help convey how to divide up the space.

If you completed all of your milestones above, you will have much of the content for this report.
But it is critical that you revise and update that content.
You have received extensive feedback throughout your design process, and evaluation of your report will 
include how you have addressed and incorporated that feedback to improve relative to your prior milestones.

1. __Title__ 

   A short, creative, and marketable title capturing the key idea.

2. __Each Team Member’s Name and Role__

3. __Problem and Solution Overview__: (1 paragraph)

   A concise statement of the problem you are tackling and a brief synopsis of your proposed solution.

4. __Contextual Inquiry Target, Stakeholders, and Participants__: (1 page)

   Describe your contextual inquiry, including the participants, their background, and their environment.
    
   Describe why you chose the particular participants in your inquiry.

5. __Contextual Inquiry Results and Themes__: (1 page)

   Discuss common themes, problems, and practices that emerged in your inquiry.
   
   Include any updated themes that emerged when considering your contextual inquiry in your design process.

6. __Answers to Task Analysis Questions__: (2 pages)

   Provide brief answers to the task analysis questions.
   
   These should be updated according to your evolved understanding of the problem and your design.

7. __Proposed Design Sketches - "3x4"__: (1 page)

   Present scanned images of your three initial designs in the context of their four tasks.
   
   Include one paragraph for each design, discussing how it supports your tasks.
   
   Include one paragraph discussing your choice of design and tasks to further pursue.

8. __Written Scenarios - "1x2"__: (1 page)

   Convert your two tasks into written scenarios for your design.
   Scenarios include the steps a person will go through to accomplish the task, including references to your design.

   Scenarios do not need to detail every little step, but should be realistic, should be dependent upon the design 
   you have chosen, should appropriately reference elements of your design, and should communicate how a person
   will accomplish the task using your design.

9. __Storyboards of the Selected Design__

   Include updated storyboards of your design. Reference these appropriately in your scenarios.

Ensure your report is appropriately clear and easy to read. This includes:

 - text should be clear and concise
 - use section headings as appropriate
 - include images in the body of the write-up with appropriate figure numbers and captions
 - refer to the figures in the body of your text
 - check for typos, spelling, and grammar errors

Be sure your presentation looks good:

 - choose appropriate colors, fonts, and styles
 - make liberal use of whitespace 

### Submission

No more than eight pages of text in PDF format, following the above outline.

Images do not count against your page limit, and are therefore effectively free. 
You should embed images throughout your PDF, keeping them near the text that references them.
The limit applies to the approximate amount of text you would have if all images were removed.

## Presentation

Due: Uploaded the night before class Thursday, October 30, 2014

Prepare a presentation of your process on getting the right design. It should encompass all of your work in the quarter to date.

__Two__ members of your team will give this presentation, and both should give relatively equal amounts of the presentation. A time limit of __eight minutes__ will be strictly enforced, so practice your presentation beforehand. There will be extra time for questions.

One way to organize this presentation is as follows:

- Title (1 slide)
- Overall problem & solution (1 slide, tell it like a story versus reading off the slide)
- Contextual Inquiry Description & Results (2 slides, include images)
- 6 Tasks (1-2 slides, at most one sentence per task)
- 3 Design Sketches (1-3 slides)
- Selected Design Storyboard and Tasks (1-2 slides)
- Summary (1 slide, summarize lessons learned)

### Submission

Your presentation may be in PPT, PPTX, or PDF format. Only one member from each group needs to upload each submission. We will put all slides on a single Windows laptop to minimize switching overhead.

Submit via Catalyst here: `link to Catalyst`

### Grading

This presentation will be graded on an holistic __10 point__ scale (converted to __5%__ of your overall course grade), and individuals presenting will be graded on a __4 point__ scale (converted to __2%__ of your overall course grade). Grading criteria include:

Presentation criteria:

- The presentation shows appropriate preparation and that visual aids are effective, properly prepared, and properly employed. Someone at the back of the room could see your slides.
- Minus 1 point if the presentation has an outline slide (this presentation is too short to need one).
- The presentation covered the required scope within the 8 minute time period.
- The presenter makes eye contact with the audience.
- The presenter projects their voice well.

Group criteria:

- The problem is presented in a way that is compelling and achievable.
- The contextual inquiry procedure carried out in a sound manner.
- The contextual inquiry results illuminating in terms of the problem.
- The tasks presented provide coverage of the functionality.
- The tasks were neither too easy nor too hard.
- The tasks were motivated by the contextual inquiry.
- Interface ideas had a strong connection to results of contextual inquiry.
- The presented ideas were appropriate for the supported tasks.
- The presented ideas were at the proper fidelity (i.e., rough sketches).
